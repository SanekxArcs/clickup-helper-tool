### âœ… Successfully Moved Rules from Dedicated Tab to Settings Modal

   - Removed Rules tab content from `popup.html`
   - Removed Rules tab references from `popup-main.js`
   - Deleted the entire `/tabs/rules/` folder and its contents
   - Removed import statement for `RulesTab` from `popup-main.js`

2. **Added Rules Modal to Settings Tab**
   - Created a comprehensive rules modal in `tabs/settings/settings.html`
   - Added "Manage Generation Rules" button in the Settings tab
   - Implemented modal with:
     - Branch naming rules textarea
     - Commit message rules textarea
     - Default examples section with "Load Default Rules" button
     - Save and Cancel buttons
     - Success message display

3. **Enhanced Settings.js with Rules Functionality**
   - Added modal management methods:
     - `openRulesModal()` - Opens the rules modal
     - `closeRulesModal()` - Closes the rules modal
     - `saveRules()` - Saves rules to Chrome storage
     - `loadDefaultRules()` - Loads predefined rule templates
     - `showRulesSavedMessage()` - Shows success message
     - `getRules()` - Public method for other tabs to access rules
   - Added event listeners for all modal interactions
